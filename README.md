## Setup/Installation Requirements

Download and Install MAMP:
* Download the free version of MAMP from the [MAMP Downloads Page](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads). Both Mac OS X and Windows are available. (You'll need to have version 4.1.0 or higher for Mac and 3.3.0 or higher for Windows).
* Once downloaded, open the file:
    * For Mac: This is a.pkg file.
    * For Windows: This is an .exe file.
* At this point, Mac installation is actually complete.
* Windows users will be prompted with an installation wizard. The default values and settings suggested at each step are just fine (You may specify a different location for your MAMP installation, if you prefer, just remember exactly where it is; we'll need to locate our MAMP installation in the next step).

### Configure Port Numbers:  
_You must configure Apache and MySQL to use the correct port numbers in MAMP._

* Launch your newly-installed MAMP program.
* A popup may appear upon first launch. If so, uncheck the option reading Check for MAMP Pro when starting MAMP (You may upgrade to MAMP Pro later, but the free version meets all requirements for our course) then click Launch MAMP.
* When MAMP launches you will be greeted by a small window with several options. Click Preferences.

* Set the Apache Port to 8888.
* Set the MySQL Port to 8889.
* Click OK to save your new port configurations.
